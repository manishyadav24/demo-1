            <p class="m-heading">Vivo X70 Pro+</p>
            <p class="m-sub">Isn't it too soon? Is it a new-new model, or is it a mid-cycle refresh? Is it in the same class, or is it up one notch? Can it justify the price increase over the previous model? A whole bunch of questions, which we'll try to answer in this review of the vivo X70 Pro+.</p>
            <p class="m-sub">The X70 Pro+ announcement came some eight months after the X60s, but since we only got the X60 Pro+ in the office in April, it feels like this next generation has arrived way early. And a quick glance at the specs of the otherwise awesome quad-camera on the back doesn't reveal improvements (one small downgrade, even). So, while imaging is clearly a top priority for this vivo - all those cameras plus the Zeiss logos scattered about the place, the upgrades must be elsewhere.
<br><br>
                There's the display, for starters. A modest increase in diagonal to 6.78 inches is only part of it - the new LTPO AMOLED panel comes with an adaptive refresh rate (up to 120Hz) as well as higher maximum brightness, and it's now QHD.
                <br><br>
                One upgrade that we almost thought we'd never see - stereo speakers - finally make it to a vivo flagship. And there's another new development that's perhaps even more surprising, welcome as it may be - the X70 Pro+ is now IP68-rated, the first vivo with dust and water protection.
                <br><br>
                At this time of the year, a switch to the SD888+ from the SD888 makes sense, and doubling the base storage to 256GB (up to an optional 512GB) is also a welcome sight. A bump in battery capacity is never a bad thing, and the addition of wireless charging we can also appreciate.
                
                </p>
            
            <div > <img class="text-image" src="assets/images/vivo2.jpg" alt=""> </div>
            <p class="m-sub">A couple of changes are giving us pause, though. For one, the overall increase in size and weight - the X60 Pro+ was a unique marriage of high-end camera hardware and a compact body, and the X70 Pro+ throws pocketability out the window. The other thing is the price - the new model is some 15% more expensive than its predecessor, which wasn't cheap to begin with.
<br><br>
                We'll delve deeper to establish if the trade-offs are worth it, but here's a quick look at the key specs before we get to it.</p>
